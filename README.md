 * I wrote a PDF-exported-TXT parser for Wayne County Michigan 2020 election data,
 * bolted it to my CSV-output and plotter, which builds on these prior successes:
 * github.com/IneffablePerformativity/ParseClarityElectionDataForOaklandCountyMI
 * github.com/IneffablePerformativity/ParseClarityElectionDataForStateOfGeorgia
 * github.com/IneffablePerformativity/ParseClarityElectionDataForStateOfColorado
 *
 * 
 * But all 4 prior programs had an error, just fixed, soon to fix in those.
 * To Wit, I did not make a "Four" thing upon each grain, but outside loop.
 * Therefore, all the vote counts were merging into forever ascending sums.
 * Corrected on 2020-11-26. Henceforth you can trust me, 'til next mistake.
 * 
 * also note, I manually compress final image at tinypng.com
