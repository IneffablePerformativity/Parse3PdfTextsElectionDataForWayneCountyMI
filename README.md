I wrote a PDF-exported-TXT parser for Wayne County Michigan 2020 election data, bolted it to my plotter.

 * I wrote a PDF-exported-TXT parser for Wayne County Michigan 2020 election data,
 * bolted it to my CSV-output and plotter, which builds on these prior successes:

 * github.com/IneffablePerformativity/ParseClarityElectionDataForStateOfGeorgia

 * FWIW, The CISR Rumor Control page says undervote (here 'Bonus') is not a sign of fraud. YMMV.
 * 
 * Wikipedia:
 * - An undervote occurs when the number of choices selected by a voter in a contest is less than the maximum number allowed for that contest or when no selection is made for a single choice contest.
